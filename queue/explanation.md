# Queue – Explanation (Data Structure)

- A queue is a linear data structure that follows the principle
FIFO – First In, First Out.

This means:

The first element inserted is the first one removed.

## Real-life example:

A line of people at a ticket counter — the person who comes first is served first.

# Basic Terms in Queue

- Front – position where elements are removed
- Rear – position where elements are inserted

# Basic Queue Operations

- Enqueue – insert an element at the rear
- Dequeue – remove an element from the front
- Peek / Front – view the front element
- isEmpty – check if queue is empty
- isFull – check if queue is full (array implementation)

# Types of Queues

## Simple Queue

- Insertion at rear, deletion at front

- Has wasted space problem in array

## Circular Queue

- Last position connects back to first
- Efficient memory usage

## Priority Queue

- Elements are removed based on priority
- Deque (Double Ended Queue)
- Insertion and deletion at both ends
